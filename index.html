                <h2>About Dylan</h2>

                <p>Dylan is a freelance website developer, IT specialist, and digital marketing consultant. His
                    background in many different industries helps him offer clients a well-rounded approach to those
                    struggling to take off, or who feel that their business is quickly growing stagnant. The digital
                    landscape is rapidly shifting, and it's important to ensure that your marketing strategy is pointing
                    you in the right direction. Outsourcing your marketing to a team of knowledgable experts is great,
                    and having an in-house team is even better, but startup costs can be astronomical. Sometimes what
                    you need most is someone like Dylan â€” a knowledgable, creative consultant that can help you get off
                    the ground, and assist you as much or as little as you need until you grow enough to scale your
                    marketing strategies even further!</p>
