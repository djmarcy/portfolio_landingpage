# Portfolio Landing Page

## Description
Code refactor for Horiseon website to bring it in line with HTML & CSS best-practices.  Alterations include:
  - Replacement of container divs with semantic tags to aid readability
  - Improving accessibility by adding alt-tags to images
  - Cleaning up duplicate CSS code
  - Reformatting/commenting out style.css stylesheet
  - Improved responsivity by making hero image an image instead of a background image of a static-sized container

Applied Scout's Rule by cleaning up existing code where applicable.
